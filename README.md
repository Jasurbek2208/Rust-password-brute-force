# Rust Password Brute Force

A password finder tool using optimized algorithms in Rust. Designed for speed with features like auto-retry on server issues and progress tracking.

## 🌟 Features

- 🚀 **Fast performance** - Optimized algorithm and minimal logging
- 🔄 **Auto retry** - Automatically changes device name when server crashes
- 📋 **Start with popular passwords** - Checks passwords that people use most often first
- 🎯 **User verification** - If the user is not found, the program stops immediately
- 📊 **Progress tracking** - Reports progress every 500 attempts
- 🌐 **Environment settings** - Ability to customize via .env file
- 📁 **Read data from file** - Read fake devices and passwords from external files

Please read the [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) documents carefully before using the program.

## 📦 Installation

1. Install Rust (if not already installed):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

2. Clone the project:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd password_finder
```

3. Install the required libraries:

```bash
cargo build
```

## ⚙️ Setup

### Create a .env file

Create a `.env` file in the project root and set the following settings:

```env
STARTER_CHAR=@
API_URL=https://example.com/api/login
LOG_LIMIT=500
```

- `STARTER_CHAR`: Username starting character (@)
- `API_URL`: API address
- `LOG_LIMIT`: Create a new log file after every attempt

### Data files

You can create the following files in the project root:

1. **fake_devices.txt** - List of fake device names
2. **common_passwords.txt** - List of popular passwords

If these files are not present, the program will use default values.

#### fake_devices.txt example:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/119.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
```

#### common_passwords.txt example:

```
password
12345678
qwertyui
admin123
```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the program:

```bash
cargo run
```

The program will ask you for the following information:

1. **Select a run method**:

- `1` - Normal (one by one)
- `2` - Asynchronous (multiple requests at the same time)

2. **If you choose asynchronous method**:

- Enter how many requests to send at a time

3. **Continue or start from the beginning**:

- `b` - Start from the beginning
- `d` - Continue from the password from the last attempt

4. **Enter username**

## 📝 Log files

The program creates log files named `password_finder_1.log`, `password_finder_2.log`, etc. A new log file is opened every 500 attempts.

The following information is stored in the log file:

- When a password is found
- When the server is blocked
- When network errors occur
- When the user is not found

## 🎯 Example

```bash
$ cargo run
The program has started
Select the operation method:
1 - Normal (one by one)
2 - Asynchronous (several requests at the same time)
1
Should we start from the beginning or continue? (b/d): b
Enter username: admin
Starting to find a password for @admin...
500 passwords tried. Current password: password12
1000 passwords tried. Current password: qwerty123
PASSWORD FOUND! Attempt 1234: User: @admin | Password: admin123 | Response: {"message":"Successful login","token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."}
The program completed successfully - password found!
```

## 📊 Asynchronous operation

If you choose the asynchronous method, the program sends multiple requests at the same time, which allows you to work faster:

```bash
$ cargo run
The program has started
Select the operation method:
1 - Normal (one by one)
2 - Asynchronous (multiple requests at the same time)
2
How many requests should be sent at the same time? 10
Working with 10 parallel requests has started.
Shall we start from the beginning or continue? (b/d): b
Enter username: testuser
Starting password recovery for @testuser...
```
